# Automate NCTL Scan for ArgoCD Workflow
## Overview

ArgoCD Diff Preview is a tool that renders the differences between two branches in a Git repository. It is designed to visualize Kubernetes manifests generated by ArgoCD, providing a clear and structured view of the changes.

This project integrates NCTL Scan to perform security and policy checks alongside the diff preview, ensuring compliance and security before applying changes
